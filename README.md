# `npm link`

Run `npm link` in `rfui-package` and then `npm link rfui-package` in this repo. When I make changes to `rfui-package` I'll have to run `npm build` in `rfui-package` for the changes to be reflected here.

Note: I also might need to do this:

```
code/rfui-package Â» npm link ../rfui-docs/node_modules/react
```

See https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.

Note: In going back and forth between `"rfui-package": "^../rfui-package"` and whatever else, I may need to delete `package-lock.json` and `node_modules` and re-run `npm install`.

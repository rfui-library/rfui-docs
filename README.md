Note: `npm link` is giving me trouble. Instead of using it, it's easier to do `"rfui-package": "file:../rfui-package"` in `package.json`. And then whenever I update `rfui-package` locally I'll need to run `npm run build` in that repo in order for the effects to show up in this repo. And I'll need to revert the `"rfui-package": "file:../rfui-package"` change before merging to `master`.
